The India Meteorological Department issued an orange alert for Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod. Moderate rainfall with gusty winds up to 50 kmph was forecasted. Residents in vulnerable areas are advised to relocate for safety. Kerala is struggling to recover from catastrophic landslides, as CCTV footage showcased the destruction in Wayanad. Shops were damaged, animals were swept away, and extreme rainfall was recorded. The government is actively conducting relief operations, which include new educational facilities and financial aid for affected individuals. More than 200 people lost their lives in the tragedy. In late July, landslides in Wayanad prompted a unique rescue effort involving off-road drivers and their 4x4 vehicles. Niyas, from Kozhikode, and Nithin Udaykrishna, returning from a motorsport challenge, were among those who navigated challenging terrains to assist in rescue operations. Their modified vehicles proved crucial in these efforts. The rising adoption of all-wheel drive vehicles in India and off-road training schools highlight their importance in disaster recovery, despite legal challenges regarding vehicle modifications. Off-roaders are increasingly recognized for their valuable role during natural calamities.",
